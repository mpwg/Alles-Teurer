# Receipt Scanning Implementation - Complete

## Overview

The receipt scanning feature is now fully implemented with proper dependency injection, LLM-based product mapping, and complete Purchase-to-Product relationship management.

## Key Implementations Completed

### 1. âœ… ModelContext Injection

**ReceiptScanViewModel** now properly receives and uses ModelContext:

```swift
@Observable
class ReceiptScanViewModel {
    var modelContext: ModelContext?
    var purchaseViewModel: PurchaseViewModel?
    // ...
}
```

This enables:
- Access to existing products in the database
- Proper product suggestions for LLM mapping
- Consistent product name normalization

### 2. âœ… Product Mapping with LLM

**ReceiptRecognitionService** now uses existing product suggestions:

```swift
func extractPurchases(
    from cgImage: CGImage,
    existingProductSuggestions: [String] = []
) async throws -> [DetectedPurchaseItem]
```

**Key Features:**
- Receives `productSuggestions` from `PurchaseViewModel` (frequent + common products)
- Combines with database products for comprehensive LLM context
- LLM receives up to 50 existing product names to map against
- **Priority mapping**: LLM tries to match receipt items to existing products FIRST
- Only creates new normalized names if no match is found

### 3. âœ… Receipt Line = Purchase Mapping

**Critical Architecture:**
- Each line on the receipt â†’ One `DetectedPurchaseItem` â†’ One `Purchase` in database
- Each `Purchase` is linked to a `Product` (normalized)
- Multiple purchases can share the same product (e.g., "Milch" bought at different stores)

**Example Flow:**
```
Receipt Line: "Clever Bio Vollmilch 3.5% 1L â‚¬ 1.29"
    â†“
DetectedPurchaseItem:
  - productName: "Clever Bio Vollmilch 3.5% 1L"
  - normalizedName: "Milch" (mapped by LLM to existing product)
  - quantity: 1.0
  - unit: "l"
  - totalPrice: 1.29
    â†“
Find or Create Product: "Milch"
    â†“
Create Purchase linked to Product "Milch"
```

### 4. âœ… LLM Instructions Enhanced

The LLM now receives comprehensive instructions for:

**Extraction:**
- Extract EVERY line as a separate item
- Ignore only: discounts, deposits, VAT, subtotals
- Parse quantities and units separately

**Normalization & Mapping:**
- **PRIMARY GOAL**: Map to existing product names when possible
- Use EXACT existing normalized names for consistency
- Remove all brand names, quantities, package types
- Use Austrian terminology (ErdÃ¤pfel, Paradeiser, Topfen)
- Only create new normalized names if no match exists

**Context Provided to LLM:**
```
BEREITS IM SYSTEM VERWENDETE PRODUKTE (BEVORZUGE DIESE):
Milch, Brot, Joghurt, KÃ¤se, Butter, Eier, ...
[Up to 50 existing product names]
```

### 5. âœ… Price Tracking Updates

When saving purchases, the system now:
- Updates product's `bestPricePerQuantity` if new purchase is cheaper
- Updates product's `highestPricePerQuantity` if new purchase is more expensive
- Records the shop name for best/worst prices
- Updates `lastUpdated` timestamp

### 6. âœ… Success State Management

```swift
var saveSuccessful: Bool = false
```

Set to `true` after successful save, allowing UI to show confirmation.

### 7. âœ… Dependency Injection Pattern

**ContentView** creates and passes dependencies:
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingReceiptScan) {
    ReceiptScanView(
        purchaseViewModel: PurchaseViewModel(
            modelContext: modelContext,
            productViewModel: productViewModel
        )
    )
}
```

**ReceiptScanView** injects into ViewModel on appear:
```swift
.onAppear {
    viewModel.modelContext = modelContext
    viewModel.purchaseViewModel = purchaseViewModel
}
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Complete Flow with Product Mapping

```
1. User selects receipt image
    â†“
2. ReceiptScanViewModel.loadSelectedPhoto()
    â†“
3. processReceiptImage(imageData)
    â†“
4. Get productSuggestions from PurchaseViewModel
    â†“
5. ReceiptRecognitionService.extractPurchases(
     cgImage: image,
     existingProductSuggestions: suggestions
   )
    â†“
6. Vision Framework extracts text
    â†“
7. Load all existing product names from database
    â†“
8. Combine with suggestions (up to 50 unique names)
    â†“
9. LLM receives:
     - Receipt text
     - Existing product names
     - Instructions to map to existing products
    â†“
10. LLM returns ParsedReceiptData:
      - shopName: "Hofer"
      - dateString: "2025-10-12"
      - lineItems: [
          {
            productName: "Clever Bio Vollmilch 3.5% 1L",
            normalizedName: "Milch",  // Mapped to existing
            priceDouble: 1.29,
            quantityDouble: 1.0,
            unit: "l"
          },
          ...
        ]
    â†“
11. Convert to DetectedPurchaseItem[]
    â†“
12. User reviews/edits items
    â†“
13. savePurchases(to: modelContext)
    â†“
14. For each DetectedPurchaseItem:
      a. Find existing Product by normalizedName OR
      b. Create new Product
      c. Create Purchase with:
         - actualProductName (original from receipt)
         - totalPrice, quantity, unit
         - shopName, date
      d. Link Purchase to Product
      e. Update Product's price bounds
    â†“
15. Save to SwiftData
    â†“
16. Set saveSuccessful = true
    â†“
17. UI shows confirmation and dismisses
```

## Benefits of This Implementation

### 1. **Product Consistency** ðŸŽ¯
- LLM prioritizes mapping to existing products
- Reduces duplicate products with similar names
- User's product list stays organized

### 2. **Smart Learning** ðŸ§ 
- The more products in the database, the better the mapping
- Frequently bought products are weighted higher in suggestions
- System "learns" user's shopping patterns

### 3. **Austrian Market Optimized** ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹
- LLM uses Austrian terminology by default
- Pre-seeded with common Austrian products
- Recognizes Austrian supermarket chains

### 4. **Proper Relationships** ðŸ”—
- Each receipt line = One Purchase
- Multiple Purchases can share one Product
- Enables price tracking across stores and time

### 5. **Flexible Normalization** ðŸ”„
- Original product name preserved in `actualProductName`
- Normalized name used for grouping/comparison
- User can see both names in UI

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Existing Product Match

**Receipt Line:**
```
Ja natÃ¼rlich Bio Vollmilch 3.5% 1L    â‚¬ 1.49
```

**LLM Processing:**
- Sees "Milch" in existing products
- Maps to existing normalized name: "Milch"

**Result:**
- Purchase created with `actualProductName = "Ja natÃ¼rlich Bio Vollmilch 3.5% 1L"`
- Linked to existing Product "Milch"
- Product price bounds updated if necessary

### Scenario 2: New Product Creation

**Receipt Line:**
```
Grana Padano gerieben 200g    â‚¬ 2.99
```

**LLM Processing:**
- No match for "Grana Padano" in existing products
- Creates normalized name: "Grana Padano"

**Result:**
- New Product created with `normalizedName = "Grana Padano"`
- Purchase created and linked
- Product initialized with current price as best/worst

### Scenario 3: Multiple Purchases, Same Product

**Receipt Lines:**
```
BILLA Bio Milch 1L              â‚¬ 1.39
Clever Vollmilch ESL 3.5% 1L    â‚¬ 1.29
```

**LLM Processing:**
- Both map to existing "Milch"

**Result:**
- 2 Purchases created
- Both linked to same Product "Milch"
- Product best price: â‚¬1.29 (Clever)
- Product worst price: â‚¬1.39 (BILLA Bio Milch)
