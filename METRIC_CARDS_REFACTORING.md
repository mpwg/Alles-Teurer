# Metric Cards Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Refactored the ProductDetailView to use reusable card components, improving code maintainability and consistency across the app.

## New Files Created

### `/Alles-Teurer/Views/Components/MetricCardView.swift`

This new file contains three reusable card components:

#### 1. `PrimaryMetricCard`

- **Purpose**: Display prominent price metrics (best/worst prices)
- **Features**:
  - Large, bold value display (28pt rounded font)
  - Icon + title header
  - Subtitle for additional context
  - Uniform height: 110pt
- **Usage**: Best for highlighting the most important metrics

#### 2. `SecondaryMetricCard`

- **Purpose**: Display supporting metrics (savings, purchase count)
- **Features**:
  - Horizontal layout with icon on the left
  - Compact but readable
  - Value, title, and subtitle hierarchy
  - Uniform height: 110pt
- **Usage**: Best for less critical but still important information

#### 3. `StatisticCard`

- **Purpose**: Display statistical analysis data
- **Features**:
  - Supports both currency and percentage formats
  - Multi-line title support for long German words
  - Vertical layout with spacer for alignment
  - Uniform height: 90pt
- **Usage**: Best for statistical metrics and analysis data

## Changes to ProductDetailView

### Before

- Three private functions: `primaryPriceCard()`, `secondaryMetricCard()`, `statisticBox()`
- ~120 lines of card-rendering code within the view
- Difficult to reuse cards elsewhere in the app

### After

- Uses reusable components: `PrimaryMetricCard`, `SecondaryMetricCard`, `StatisticCard`
- ~40 lines cleaner, more readable code
- Cards can be easily reused in other views
- Consistent styling across the app is guaranteed

## Benefits

### 1. **Reusability**

All card components can now be used anywhere in the app with consistent styling.

### 2. **Maintainability**

Styling changes only need to be made once in the component files, not across multiple views.

### 3. **Testability**

Each card component has its own preview for easy visual testing and iteration.

### 4. **Readability**

The ProductDetailView is now much cleaner and easier to understand.

### 5. **Consistency**

All cards now have uniform heights and spacing:

- Primary & Secondary cards: 110pt minimum height
- Statistic cards: 90pt minimum height
- Consistent corner radius: 12pt
- Consistent spacing: 12-16pt

## Mobile-First Design Improvements

1. **Two-column layout**: Changed from 4 columns to 2 for better mobile readability
2. **Larger touch targets**: All cards have adequate size for mobile interaction
3. **Better hierarchy**: Primary metrics are more prominent than secondary metrics
4. **Improved spacing**: Optimized padding and spacing for mobile screens
5. **Uniform heights**: All cards in a row have the same height for a polished look

## Example Usage

```swift
// Primary metric card
PrimaryMetricCard(
    title: "Bester Preis",
    value: "€2,49/kg",
    subtitle: "bei Lidl",
    color: .green,
    icon: "arrow.down.circle.fill"
)

// Secondary metric card
SecondaryMetricCard(
    title: "Einkäufe",
    value: "16",
    subtitle: "Transaktionen",
    color: .blue,
    icon: "cart.fill"
)

// Statistic card
StatisticCard(
    title: "Durchschnitt",
    value: 3.33,
    color: .orange
)

// Statistic card with percentage
StatisticCard(
    title: "Variationskoeffizient",
    value: 13.5,
    isPercentage: true,
    color: .pink
)
```

## Future Enhancements

These reusable components can be extended with:

- Animation support
- Tap gestures for interactivity
- Accessibility improvements (VoiceOver hints)
- Dark mode optimizations
- Additional card variants (e.g., tertiary cards, list cards)
- Custom background colors or gradients
