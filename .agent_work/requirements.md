# Backend Sync Feature - Requirements

## Overview

This document defines the requirements for adding an optional backend synchronization feature to the Alles-Teurer grocery price tracking app. The backend sync will allow users to optionally synchronize their Product and Purchase data to a remote backend server.

## User Stories

### US-1: Enable Backend Sync

**As a** user  
**I want to** optionally enable backend synchronization  
**So that** my grocery price data is backed up to a remote server

### US-2: Configure Backend Connection

**As a** user  
**I want to** configure my backend server URL and authentication  
**So that** I can sync to my preferred backend instance

### US-3: Manual Sync Trigger

**As a** user  
**I want to** manually trigger a sync operation  
**So that** I can control when my data is synchronized

### US-4: Automatic Sync

**As a** user  
**I want to** have my data automatically sync when changes are made  
**So that** my backend always has the latest data without manual intervention

### US-5: Offline Operation

**As a** user  
**I want to** continue using the app when offline  
**So that** I can track prices even without internet connectivity

## Functional Requirements (EARS Notation)

### Backend Configuration

**REQ-1**: THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a settings toggle to enable/disable backend synchronization

**REQ-2**: THE SYSTEM SHALL allow users to configure a backend server URL

**REQ-3**: THE SYSTEM SHALL allow users to configure an API authentication token

**REQ-4**: WHEN backend sync is disabled, THE SYSTEM SHALL operate entirely offline with local storage only

**REQ-5**: WHEN backend sync settings are changed, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the configuration before enabling sync

### Data Synchronization

**REQ-6**: WHEN backend sync is enabled, THE SYSTEM SHALL perform an initial full sync of all local data to the backend

**REQ-7**: WHEN a Product is created or updated locally, THE SYSTEM SHALL sync the changes to the backend

**REQ-8**: WHEN a Purchase is created or updated locally, THE SYSTEM SHALL sync the changes to the backend

**REQ-9**: WHEN a Product or Purchase is deleted locally, THE SYSTEM SHALL sync the deletion to the backend

**REQ-10**: WHEN the user manually triggers a sync, THE SYSTEM SHALL synchronize all pending changes to the backend

**REQ-11**: WHILE the app is online, THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically sync changes within 5 seconds of local modifications

**REQ-12**: WHILE the app is offline, THE SYSTEM SHALL queue changes for synchronization when connectivity is restored

### Conflict Resolution

**REQ-13**: WHEN a sync conflict occurs (same entity modified locally and remotely), THE SYSTEM SHALL use the most recent modification timestamp to determine the winner

**REQ-14**: WHEN applying remote changes, THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve the relationship between Products and Purchases

**REQ-15**: WHEN syncing Product price bounds, THE SYSTEM SHALL recalculate best/worst prices from all Purchases

### Error Handling

**REQ-16**: IF network connectivity is unavailable, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL continue operating with local data and retry sync when online

**REQ-17**: IF backend authentication fails, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL notify the user and disable automatic sync

**REQ-18**: IF a sync operation fails, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and allow the user to retry

**REQ-19**: IF the backend returns a server error (5xx), THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL retry the sync with exponential backoff

**REQ-20**: IF the backend returns a client error (4xx), THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL not retry and notify the user

### Data Integrity

**REQ-21**: THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure that all synced data maintains referential integrity (Purchases reference valid Products)

**REQ-22**: THE SYSTEM SHALL use unique identifiers for Products and Purchases that are consistent across local and backend storage

**REQ-23**: THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve all data fields when syncing (including Austrian locale-specific formatting)

**REQ-24**: THE SYSTEM SHALL not sync any data when backend sync is disabled

### User Interface

**REQ-25**: THE SYSTEM SHALL display the last successful sync timestamp in the settings

**REQ-26**: THE SYSTEM SHALL indicate sync status (syncing, synced, error) in the UI

**REQ-27**: THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a manual sync button in the settings

**REQ-28**: WHEN backend sync is enabled, THE SYSTEM SHALL show a sync status indicator

**REQ-29**: WHEN a sync error occurs, THE SYSTEM SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Security

**REQ-30**: THE SYSTEM SHALL store the backend API token securely using iOS/macOS Keychain

**REQ-31**: THE SYSTEM SHALL use HTTPS for all backend communication

**REQ-32**: THE SYSTEM SHALL include the API token in request headers for authentication

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

**NFR-1**: Initial sync of 1000 Products and 5000 Purchases SHALL complete within 30 seconds on a stable internet connection

**NFR-2**: Incremental sync of a single change SHALL complete within 2 seconds on a stable internet connection

**NFR-3**: The sync process SHALL not block the UI thread

### Reliability

**NFR-4**: The sync service SHALL have a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient failures

**NFR-5**: The app SHALL remain fully functional during sync operations

**NFR-6**: Failed sync operations SHALL not corrupt local data

### Compatibility

**NFR-7**: The backend sync feature SHALL work on both iOS and macOS platforms

**NFR-8**: The backend sync feature SHALL not interfere with the existing CloudKit family sharing feature

**NFR-9**: The backend API SHALL support versioning for future compatibility

### Usability

**NFR-10**: Backend configuration SHALL require no more than 3 user inputs (URL, token, enable toggle)

**NFR-11**: Error messages SHALL be in German (de_AT locale) consistent with the rest of the app

## Constraints

**CON-1**: Backend sync must be completely optional and opt-in

**CON-2**: The app must continue to function fully when backend sync is disabled

**CON-3**: Backend sync and CloudKit family sharing are mutually independent features

**CON-4**: Debug and Release builds shall use separate backend sync configurations

## Assumptions

**ASM-1**: Users who enable backend sync have a compatible backend server available

**ASM-2**: The backend server provides RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations

**ASM-3**: Users will provide a valid API token for authentication

**ASM-4**: The backend server handles user isolation and multi-tenancy

## Out of Scope

- Backend server implementation (this spec covers only the client-side sync)
- User registration/authentication flow (assumes users obtain tokens externally)
- Data migration between CloudKit and backend sync
- Real-time collaborative editing (conflicts resolved by timestamp only)
